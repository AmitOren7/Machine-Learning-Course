## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project implements a **full ML pipeline** for predicting sentiment (positive/negative) of social media posts, covering data collection, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and final prediction.

- **Goal:** Predict post sentiment based on textual and contextual features.  
- **Dataset:** Static dataset of posts (text, user info, likes, shares).  
- **Pipeline:**
  - **Data Collection & Sensing:** Collected static data from posts.  
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explored distributions and correlations to uncover sentiment-related patterns.  
  - **Preprocessing:** Cleaned missing values, encoded categorical variables, and generated new features.  
  - **Feature Extraction:** Extracted semantic and syntactic features using TF-IDF and N-grams.  
  - **Feature Selection:** Selected top 25 features using Fisher Score to reduce dimensionality and overfitting.  
  - **Validation:** Applied 10-fold cross-validation with strict separation to avoid data leakage.  
  - **Model Training:** Trained Decision Tree, SVM, and MLP models; tuned hyperparameters using RandomizedSearchCV.  
  - **Evaluation:** Analyzed confusion matrices, ROC curves, and feature importance for each model.  
  - **Improvements:** Suggested enhancements in feature design and user profiling to boost performance.  
  - **Final Prediction:** Predicted sentiment on a hold-out test set using the complete ML pipeline.
